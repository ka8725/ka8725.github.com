My name is Andrei Kaleshka. I live in Belarus, Minsk. I've been working with **Ruby On Rails** framework since 2009.
During this period of time I was working on a lot of Rails projects.
The list contains different types of projects including **SaaS** applications, **CMS** systems, **billing** systems, **REST API** and so on.

Apart of the commercial commitment I have contributed to open source projects:
Rails, Datagrid, Inherited resources, Devise, Sinatra, Rake, Enumerize, Homebrew, Cocaine and so on.
The whole list you may see following [this link](https://github.com/ka8725).

In a development process I always follow TDD principles, I do construct or take an active part in a project architecture, deployment processes and a workflow. In the past I was a Java developer, that's why it affects my programming decisions to the best. In code I prefer to apply design patterns where it's possible and reasonable, pay more attention to code reliability and flexibility. I have big experience in a project refactoring. I prefer to solve problems rather than creating them.

The main achievement in my experience as a **Ruby developer** is a writing the book [Rake Task Management Essentials](http://www.packtpub.com/rake-task-management-essentials/book). Yes, I'm the sole author of the book.

If you wanted to hire me then you would like to see my CV. It's located [here](/files/cv.pdf).
