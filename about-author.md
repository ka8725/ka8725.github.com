My name is Andrei Kaleshka. I've been working with **Ruby/Rails** since 2009. Using this technology I've implemented many projects:
**SaaS** applications, **CMS** and **billing** systems, **API** (REST and GraphQL), etc.

Apart the commercial commitment I've contributed to open source projects:
Rails, Datagrid, Inherited resources, Devise, Sinatra, Rake, Enumerize, Homebrew, Cocaine, etc.
See the whole list [here](https://github.com/ka8725?tab=repositories).

I'm also the sole book author of [Rake Task Management Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/product/rake-task-management-essentials/9781783280773?_ga=2.19088061.400786981.1668522155-1689462152.1668522155).

I would be glad to help with implementing an IT project of your dream. See my [CV](/files/cv.pdf).
